# Credit Risk analysis-EDA

**AIM**


Minimise risk and maximise profitability for a bank by identifying customers who are capable of repaying their loans by analysing historical trends and performing exploratory data analysis.

This assignment aims to give us an idea of applying 
EDA in a real business scenario. In this assignment, 
apart from applying the techniques of EDA, we will also develop a 
basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and 
financial services and understand how data is used to 
minimise the risk of losing money while lending to 
customers.

**BUSINESS PROBLEM**

The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to people due to their inadequate or missing credit history. Some consumers use this to their advantage by becoming a defaulter. Let us consider your work for a consumer finance company that specialises in lending various types of loans to customers. You must use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyse the patterns present in the data which will make sure that the loans are not rejected for the applicants capable of repaying.

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to rights for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s or company’s decision:

--If the aspirant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan tends in a business loss to the company
--If the a is aspirant not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default/fraud, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
